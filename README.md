# PlatonEditor

PlatonEditor is organized into clear folders so you can work step by step.
You do not need to understand everything at once.

## What This Repository Contains
- `editor/`: the product features people use.
- `lang-engine/`: language behavior behind parsing and code understanding.
- `ci/`: automation scripts for checks and releases.
- `benchmarks/`: speed and stability measurement scenarios.

## How To Work Safely
1. Choose one folder.
2. Read that folder README first.
3. Make a small change.
4. Run checks for that folder.
5. Only then move to the next change.

## For Beginners
Start with one small folder and one small file.
Do not try to change multiple systems in one commit.

## For Intermediate Contributors
Work by feature boundaries.
Keep changes readable and test after each step.

## For Professional Contributors
Review cross-folder impact before merge.
Keep behavior stable and regression risk low.

## Project Goal
Clear code, predictable behavior, and reliable delivery.
